Make a dedicated *editor type* for the Robot designer
-----------------------------------------------------

Currently, this can only be done in C code right now. See `this tutorial <http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:2.6/Source/Tutorials/AddAnEditor>`_
for more details. Even in the development version of Blender `this seems not be to be possible (yet) <https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_75_release/info_quickstart.html>`_.

Custom icons
------------

This became possible since `version 2.75 of Blender <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/32335/how-to-implement-custom-icons-for-my-script-addon>`_.
