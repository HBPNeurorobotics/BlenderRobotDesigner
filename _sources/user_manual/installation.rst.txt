Manual Installation
===================

Get a copy
----------

The RobotDesigner of the *HBP-SP10: Neurorobotics* is open source and hosted on
`GitHUB <https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/BlenderRobotDesigner>`_.  The source code of the newest version can be downloaded
as a zipped file from `here <https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/BlenderRobotDesigner/archive/master.zip>`_, or
if the GIT version control system is installed, like this:

.. code-block:: console

   user@hbp ~$ cd projects
   user@hbp ~/projects $ git clone https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/BlenderRobotDesigner.git
   user@hbp ~/projects$ cd BlenderRobotDesigner/


Installer
---------

Current
^^^^^^^
Important: You should have a latest blender (version>=2.77) on your computer. Your version of blender should have a built-in python.
Installation steps on Linux and Windows:

1. Download blender from the dedicated website: https://www.blender.org/download/
2. Download "installer.blend" from our github: https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/BlenderRobotDesigner/blob/master/installer.blend
3. Launch blender and open the installer.blend file, click "run script" and wait until "RD Installation Done!" appears
4. Close and launch blender again, you will find HBP addon on the top left of blender GUI (Note: if the HBP tab does not appear in the tool shelf, navigate to File->User Preferences->Add-Ons tab, search for and select the NRP Robot Designer add-on, and click "Save User Settings".)

(Note: You can launch blender from terminal to make sure that you choose the right version of blender if you have multiple blenders on your computer)


Planned installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the next version of the installer, we investigate the usage of the ``venv`` environment shipped with
Python starting from version 3.3, which will allow the installation of external (pure python) packages to Blender.
