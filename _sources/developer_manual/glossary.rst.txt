    operator
            Python class objects to modify the blender scene. (see :ref:`blender_concepts`)

    geometry
    mesh
        In Blender, an :term:`object` containing a surface model (*mesh*) is referred to
        as *geometry*(see :ref:`blender_concepts`)


    segment
        A segement of a robot model consists of a joint and a link, where meshes, a physics frame and a controller can be attached.

    bone
        Bones of Blender (see https://docs.blender.org/manual/de/dev/rigging/armatures/bones/index.html) are supplemented
        in the Robot Designer to meet robot kinematic requirements. Bones not generated by the Robot Designer can
        simply be imported when prompted.

    model
        The blender model collects all information about the generated design such as meshes and surface properties.


    robot model
        A robot model in the Robot Designer includes the kinematic chain of a generated robot and all its properties such as physics
        frames, controllers, (collision) meshes, sensors and model meta data.


    armature
        An *armature* in Blender is the skeleton of the model and enables simulated motions
        (See the Blender manual https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/rigging/armatures/index.html and :ref:`blender_concepts`)

    property
        *Properties* are the only method in Blender to store/access additional data.
        (see :ref:`blender_concepts`)

    decorator
        In brief, ...

    condition
        Here, ...

    mode:   edit mode,    object mode,    pose mode
        Blender has different operating modes to focus working on different properties, where some are specific to :term:`armatures`
        (see https://docs.blender.org/manual/it/dev/modeling/meshes/introduction.html)

    collision mesh
        For the Robot Designer a custom collision tag can be assigned to meshes to indicate the usage as a collision mesh.
        A collision mesh will be used for physical contact detection in gazebo simulator.


    scene
        The blender environment containing the objects is called the scene.

    IDE
        Integrated Development Environment
